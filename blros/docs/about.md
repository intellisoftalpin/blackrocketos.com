## Black Rocket OS Security

Black Rocket OS is a fork of Graphene OS, which sets a new standard in mobile security and privacy.
With its advanced security architecture, it protects your digital assets and personal data against vulnerabilities and threats.

Black Rocket OS stands out as a secure and private mobile operating system that enhances the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) framework without compromising on usability and app compatibility. It emphasizes technical advancements in privacy and security rather than relying on marketing tactics, ensuring robust protection against unknown vulnerabilities through attack surface reduction, exploit mitigations, and improved sandboxing.

Noteworthy for not bundling Google services intrusively, GrapheneOS provides a secure environment that supports
broad carrier functionality without invasive access, emphasizes privacy by default, and includes unique features
like sandboxed Google Play, enhanced verified boot, and extensive exploit mitigations. Additionally,
it offers hardened applications like Vanadium for web browsing and Auditor for hardware-based security verification,
alongside other specialized features to improve user privacy and security further.
